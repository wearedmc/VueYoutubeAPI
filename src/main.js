  1. Talk about frameworks available online that can quickly get you set up like vue-cli
  2. Inform student that the following will be necessary and to not worry, resources for all explained will be in the resources doc
    - Atom or Sublime, Chrome with vue-devtools, Sourcetree
    - Babel transpiler/mod for text editor
    - Have them install xCode if they are using a Mac and launch the Apple Simulator with iPhone 6
    - Show them how to split the screen to have the editor and the terminal one one screen
    - Node (tell them to pause and follow the instructions on how to get node set up)
    - eslint -g, babel-core -g, webpack -g, vue-cli -g walk student through installing vue-devtools and Sourcetree while npm packages are loading
    - vue-cli - search on web to pull up docs and walk student through (will take time, flip back to vue docs and render lists or pause recording)
